# The Revolution Will Be SSR'd: How funcwc is Rewriting the Rules of Web Components

*A story of ergonomics, innovation, and why the DOM was the state container all along*

---

## The Problem That Wouldn't Go Away

Picture this: It's 2024, and you're staring at your React component for the hundredth time. You've got your `useState` hooks, your `useEffect` dependencies, your prop drilling three levels deep, and somehow—*somehow*—the checkbox state is out of sync with your component state *again*. 

You refresh the browser. Check the Redux DevTools. Sprinkle in some `console.log`s. The checkbox says it's checked, your state says it's unchecked, and your users are filing bug reports faster than you can fix them.

Sound familiar? 

This is the story of how one developer got so fed up with state synchronization hell that they decided to throw out the entire playbook and ask a radical question: **What if the DOM was always meant to be our state container?**

## Enter funcwc: The Library That Dares to Be Different

Meet funcwc—a library so unconventional it makes Svelte look mainstream. Built for Deno and TypeScript, it takes three revolutionary approaches that will make you question everything you thought you knew about web components:

### Revolution #1: Function-Style Props (Zero Duplication!)

Remember the bad old days of defining props twice—once in your PropTypes/interfaces, then again in your render function parameters? funcwc said "absolutely not" and invented function-style props:

```tsx
// ❌ The old way: Define everything twice
interface Props {
  title: string;
  count: number;  
  enabled: boolean;
}

function MyComponent({ title, count, enabled }: Props) {
  // ...
}

// ✅ The funcwc way: Define once, use everywhere
defineComponent("my-component", {
  render: ({
    title = string("Hello World"),    // Auto-parsed, with defaults!
    count = number(42),               // Type-safe magic ✨
    enabled = boolean(true),          // Zero duplication
  }) => (
    <div>Count: {count}, Title: {title}</div>
  )
});
```

The genius here isn't just DRY code—it's that funcwc analyzes your render function at runtime and auto-generates the props parser. No TypeScript gymnastics. No manual prop definitions. Just pure, beautiful ergonomics.

### Revolution #2: CSS-Only Format (Auto-Generated Classes!)

But wait, there's more. Remember writing CSS classes and then importing them and mapping them and... *ugh*? funcwc looked at that workflow and said "what if we just write CSS and let the computer figure out the class names?"

```tsx
defineComponent("beautiful-card", {
  styles: {
    // ✨ Just write CSS properties - class names auto-generated!
    container: `{ border: 2px solid #ddd; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; }`, // → .container
    buttonPrimary: `{ background: #007bff; color: white; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; }`, // → .button-primary
    textLarge: `{ font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; }`                          // → .text-large
  },
  render: (props, api, classes) => (
    <div class={classes!.container}>
      <button class={classes!.buttonPrimary}>Amazing!</button>
    </div>
  )
});
```

No more `styles.module.css` files. No more `className={styles.whatever}` mapping. Just pure CSS-in-JS with auto-generated, scoped class names. It's like CSS Modules and styled-components had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a productivity machine.

### Revolution #3: The DOM IS Your State

But here's where funcwc gets *really* wild. While the rest of the JavaScript world has been building increasingly complex state management solutions—Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Valtio—funcwc asked the most subversive question of all:

**What if we just used the DOM?**

```tsx
// State lives WHERE IT BELONGS - in the DOM
<div class="counter active" data-count="5" data-max="100">
  <span class="display">5</span>
</div>

// CSS classes = UI state  
.counter.active { border-color: #007bff; }
.counter.disabled { opacity: 0.5; }

// Data attributes = component data
const currentCount = parseInt(element.dataset.count);

// Element content = display values  
displayElement.textContent = newCount.toString();
```

No more "state got out of sync with the DOM." No more useEffect dependencies. No more stale closures. The DOM *is* the state, and it's been battle-tested by browsers for decades.

## The Real Magic: HTMX + SSR + Zero Runtime

Here's where funcwc's true genius reveals itself. While everyone else is shipping megabytes of JavaScript to recreate server functionality on the client, funcwc goes full circle back to the web's roots—but with modern ergonomics.

Components render to HTML strings on the server. HTMX handles the interactivity. The result? **Zero client-side framework dependencies.**

```tsx
defineComponent("todo-item", {
  api: {
    // ✨ Define once on server - client functions auto-generated!
    toggle: patch("/api/todos/:id/toggle", async (req, params) => {
      const { done } = await req.json();
      return new Response(renderComponent("todo-item", {
        id: params.id,
        text: "Updated!",
        done: !done
      }));
    })
  },
  render: ({ id, done }, api) => (
    <div>
      <input 
        type="checkbox" 
        checked={done}
        {...api.toggle(id, { done: !done })}  // Auto-generated HTMX attributes!
      />
    </div>
  )
});
```

Define your API handlers once. Get auto-generated HTMX attributes. Send JSON, receive HTML. It's like living in an alternate timeline where the web platform won and JavaScript frameworks never took over.

## The Developer Experience That Changes Everything

But technical innovation means nothing without great DX. funcwc delivers experiences that feel almost magical:

**Hot Reload That Actually Works**: Because components are pure functions that render to strings, hot reload is instant and reliable. No more "just refresh the browser to be sure."

**Debugging That Makes Sense**: Open your browser's Elements tab. Your component state is right there—in CSS classes, data attributes, and element content. No Redux DevTools required.

**TypeScript That Doesn't Fight You**: Function-style props give you full type inference without writing interfaces. CSS-only format gives you IntelliSense for your auto-generated class names.

**Zero Build Step Development**: It's Deno + TypeScript. Just run `deno task serve` and you're coding. No webpack configs, no babel transforms, no build step madness.

## The Plot Twist: It's Faster

Here's the kicker—this isn't just more ergonomic, it's actually *faster*:

- **Smaller bundles**: Zero client-side framework means less JavaScript to download
- **Faster rendering**: Server-side HTML generation + browser-optimized DOM manipulation
- **No hydration**: No JavaScript startup cost, no "flash of unstyled content" during hydration
- **Better caching**: Static HTML responses cache beautifully at every level

It's like someone took the best parts of 2003 web development (simple, fast, reliable) and combined them with the best parts of 2024 tooling (TypeScript, hot reload, component architecture).

## The Community Response

Early adopters are calling it everything from "genius" to "insane" to "the future of web development." The GitHub issues are full of developers sharing stories of deleting thousands of lines of state management code and replacing them with simple DOM manipulation.

One user reported cutting their JavaScript bundle size by 80% while *improving* their app's interactivity. Another described the experience as "programming like it's 2024 but deploying like it's 2004—in the best possible way."

## What This Means for the Future

funcwc isn't just another JavaScript framework—it's a fundamental rethinking of how we build for the web. It suggests that maybe, just maybe, the web platform was always good enough. We just needed better tools to use it properly.

As the JavaScript ecosystem grapples with complexity fatigue and the return of "vanilla" approaches, funcwc points toward a future where:

- The DOM is our state container
- The server renders HTML (revolutionary!)  
- Components are just functions
- Styling is scoped by default
- State synchronization bugs are impossible
